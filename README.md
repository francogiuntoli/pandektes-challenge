# Pandektes Case Law Extractor

This NestJS service ingests a case law document (HTML or PDF), extracts structured metadata with an LLM, and stores the result in PostgreSQL via Prisma. It also exposes an endpoint to retrieve and/or delete an extracted case.

## Tech Stack

- **NestJS 11** for the application framework
- **Prisma ORM** on top of **PostgreSQL**
- **OpenAI-compatible LLM** (uses the OpenAI Responses API by default)
- **Cheerio** / **pdf-parse** for lightweight text extraction prior to prompting the LLM
- **Passport.js + JWT** for stateless authentication
- **Swagger UI** for interactive documentation and testing

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 9+
- Docker (for the local PostgreSQL instance)
- An OpenAI (or compatible) API key with access to a JSON-capable model

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
2. **Copy environment template and set secrets**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Update `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`, and the seed credentials before running migrations.
3. **Start PostgreSQL**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
4. **Generate the Prisma client & run the initial migration**
   ```bash
   pnpm exec prisma generate
   pnpm exec prisma migrate dev
   ```
5. **Seed a demo application user** (credentials taken from `SEED_USER_EMAIL` / `SEED_USER_PASSWORD`)
   ```bash
   pnpm db:seed
   ```
6. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   pnpm run start:dev
   ```

The server listens on `http://localhost:3000` by default. Interactive API docs live at `http://localhost:3000/docs`.

## API

All REST endpoints (except `/` and `/auth/login`) require a valid `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. The same bearer token is used for authenticated GraphQL operations in Apollo Explorer.

### REST endpoints

#### `POST /auth/login`
Authenticate with the seeded (or self-managed) user credentials to obtain a JWT access token. Example body:

```json
{
  "email": "franco@pandektes.com",
  "password": "should_hire_me"
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "accessToken": "<jwt>",
  "tokenType": "Bearer",
  "expiresIn": 900,
  "user": {
    "id": "a3f538f1-3f0f-4a31-9a27-7f9fa0dfc2a5",
    "email": "franco@pandektes.com"
  }
}
```

#### `GET /docs`
Swagger UI for exploring the API. Use the **Authorize** button to paste the JWT and issue authenticated requests directly from the browser.

#### `POST /cases/import`
Multipart form-data upload (requires the bearer token) that expects a `file` field containing either the HTML or PDF case file. On success it returns the stored resource.

Sample response body:
```json
{
  "id": "b2f4a6ce-1c19-4eb3-9d4e-80cf98cb2448",
  "title": "Example v. Example",
  "decisionType": "Judgment",
  "decisionDate": "2024-01-15T00:00:00.000Z",
  "office": "Example Board",
  "court": "Court of Justice of the European Union",
  "caseNumber": "C-123/24",
  "summary": "…",
  "conclusion": "…",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-20T12:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-01-20T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

If a case with the same `caseNumber` already exists it will be updated; otherwise it is created.

#### `GET /cases/{id}`
Fetches a single case resource by its UUID (requires bearer token).

#### `DELETE /cases/{id}`
Deletes a single case resource by its UUID (requires bearer token).

### GraphQL (Apollo Explorer)

- When the dev server is running, open `http://localhost:3000/graphql` in the browser to launch Apollo Explorer (a.k.a. Apollo Sandbox). It introspects the schema automatically.
- Use the `Headers` panel in Explorer to store `Authorization: Bearer <token>` once you obtain a JWT (see login mutation below).
- Explorer persists operations, so you can save the examples that follow into your personal collection for quick reuse.

#### Authenticate and capture the JWT

```graphql
mutation Login($input: LoginInput!) {
  login(input: $input) {
    accessToken
    tokenType
    expiresIn
    user {
      id
      email
    }
  }
}
```

Variables:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "email": "franco@pandektes.com",
    "password": "should_hire_me"
  }
}
```

Copy the `accessToken` from the response and add `Authorization: Bearer <token>` in Explorer's headers before issuing the next operations.

#### Fetch a case by id

```graphql
query Case($id: String!) {
  case(id: $id) {
    id
    title
    decisionType
    decisionDate
    office
    court
    caseNumber
    summary
    conclusion
    createdAt
    updatedAt
  }
}
```

Variables:

```json
{
  "id": "b2f4a6ce-1c19-4eb3-9d4e-80cf98cb2448"
}
```

#### Import a case file via upload

```graphql
mutation ImportCase($file: Upload!) {
  importCase(file: $file) {
    id
    title
    decisionType
    decisionDate
    office
    court
    caseNumber
    summary
    conclusion
    createdAt
    updatedAt
  }
}
```

In Explorer, open the **Files** panel, add a file, and assign it to the `$file` variable before running the mutation. PDFs and HTML case files follow the same validation rules as the REST importer.

#### Delete a case

```graphql
mutation DeleteCase($id: String!) {
  deleteCase(id: $id) {
    id
    title
    caseNumber
  }
}
```

Variables:

```json
{
  "id": "b2f4a6ce-1c19-4eb3-9d4e-80cf98cb2448"
}
```

## Environment Variables

| Name | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | ✅ | Connection string for Prisma (PostgreSQL). |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | ✅ | API key for the OpenAI-compatible provider. |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | ❌ | Comma-separated list of allowed origins for CORS. Defaults to allow all origins. |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | ❌ | Override for the model name (defaults to `gpt-4o-mini`). [OpenAI Models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) - Must have structured outputs |
| `JWT_SECRET` | ✅ | Secret used to sign JWT access tokens. |

## Key Decisions & Trade-offs

- **OpenAI Responses API**: Chosen for native JSON mode, simplifying schema validation. This can be swapped with any compatible provider by adjusting `ExtractionService`.
- **LLM-first parsing**: HTML/PDF parsing is intentionally minimal. The cleaning is done before handing control to the LLM to keep the implementation flexible. More robust tools like doculing could be used for data extraction. Also other LLMs to consume PDF files directly for a better data extraction (text layout recognition).
- **Upsert by `caseNumber`**: Helps avoid duplicates when re-processing previously ingested documents. Cases without a number are treated as unique inserts.

## Production Hardening Ideas

1. Automated retries and rate-limit handling for LLM providers.
2. Persist the original file and/or structured JSON blob for traceability.
3. Add structured validations + business rules (e.g. enforce required fields based on decision type).
4. Implement background jobs for extraction so uploads return quickly.
5. Test coverage (unit tests for extraction pipeline, e2e tests hitting a mock LLM).

## Troubleshooting

- **`prisma generate` missing**: Ensure `pnpm exec prisma generate` has been run after installing dependencies.
- **LLM failures**: Confirm the API key has access to JSON mode and that the document text is within size limits (service truncates to ~15k characters per request but can be updated by adjusting `RAW_TEXT_MAX_LENGTH`).
- **Docker port conflicts**: Update the exposed port in `docker-compose.yml` and `DATABASE_URL` accordingly.
